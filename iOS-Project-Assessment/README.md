iOS Take Home Project

I have implemented all the features that were required, the only issue that occured is when clicking on a task I was not able to get the checkmark to appear and dissapear. I did have an idea on how to do it and it is implemented in comments, but when I ran the code it crashed the application so I commented that part out. However the rest of the application is functioning correctly with no errors. You can add a task, edit it, and swipe to delete it.
